What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When we initialize a repository, git will make a "hidden" or special
    folder in which it will hold and manage the changes among the files
    that are and will be committed. It is necessary to initialize the
    repository when we want to create a new one.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area seems to be a "place" where files are remembered
    or recorded for the next commit.
