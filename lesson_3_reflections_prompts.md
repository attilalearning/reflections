#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?#

    If I want to collaborate with others I would use a remote repository
    like GitHub. But also, if I would like to make my project available to
    others or to get feedback from others, I would use a remote repository
    too.

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?#

    Probably because I could have some uncommitted changes in my working
    directory and so, if an auto-update would be performed, I assume I
    would loose my changes?!
