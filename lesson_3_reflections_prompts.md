#When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?#

    If I want to collaborate with others I would use a remote repository
    like GitHub. But also, if I would like to make my project available to
    others or to get feedback from others, I would use a remote repository
    too.

#Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?#

    Probably because I could have some uncommitted changes in my working
    directory and so, if an auto-update would be performed, I assume I
    would loose my changes?!

#Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?#

    Branches are used when we want to experiment within our project.

    We do clones when we want to "download" a project that is on GitHub or
    when we want to create a copy of one of our projects locally, to a
    different location on our own computer.

    And we use fork to copy someone else's project on GitHub (to our own
    account, still on GitHub). By using fork, we let the original creator of
    the project know about us having a copy (and also, as I've seen the
    options on GitHub, we may, later on, push the changes we made to such a
    project to the original repo on GitHub).

#What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?#

    When we have the last known state od the remote stored locally, we can
    check to see the changes and the branches (graph). Then, we can decide
    if any merging is needed and can proceed if so.
